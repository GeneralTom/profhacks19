            | This year’s theme is Smart Space, which aims to design systems and use technology to connect the Earth with our solar system at large. It’s time to think of
            | large scale design and how each of their subsystems interact. From gathering environmental data from satellites to image recognition and flight analytics, Smart
            | Space allows you to design systems on a massive scale. You can go to Mars and beyond or bring it back down to Earth! This year with a wider focus, projects can go
            | to infinity and beyond!

            p Data is all around us, from the amount of air we breathe to the frequency of potholes on the roads we use to get to work. By collecting this data, we can use a network of sensors to create patterns in the environment that can be measured and predicted. How will you use data to tell a story?

            h3 IEEE Student Branch
            p Are you or one of your teammates an IEEE member? If so, then this may be the track for you! Design a product that helps advance technology for the benefit of humanity. Cities come in all shapes and sizes. Create a product that can accommodate for those differences and improve people’s quality of life.

            h3 Entrepeneurship
            p Design and pitch a scalable product/service that can be utilized to improve the efficiency of some aspect of a city. This product/service should be something entirely new or an improvement on current technology. Remember, the product is important, but so is the pitch!
